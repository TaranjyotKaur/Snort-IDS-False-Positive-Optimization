# Snort-IDS-False-Positive-Optimization

Snort IDS – False Positive Optimization

This project is a continuation of my first Snort IDS project.
While testing detection rules, I noticed excessive alerts for normal traffic, so this project focuses on reducing false positives.

Two basic Snort rules were optimized using detection filters to reduce alert noise while maintaining detection accuracy.

Tools: Snort, Kali Linux, Nmap, Ping
